Recursion

	To solve a problem with recursion the problem has to be split up into smaller problems of the same form.
	
Generic class

	The objects of a generic class can be of any type. The type is a parameter of a generic class.
	
Wrapper class

	There a wrapper classes for primitive data types, because for example ArrayLists can only work with objects.
	
Boxing and unboxing

	Java takes a primitive data type and automatically converts it to its corresponding wrapper class. Same in reverse.
	
Garbage collection

	Garbage collection frees up unused (nothing is pointing at it) memory in heap.
	
Heap

	The heap is a part of the memory where objects are stored.
	
Stack

	The stack is where local variables of method calls are stored.
	
Object reference

	Object variables store a reference to the address on the heap where the object is actually stored.
