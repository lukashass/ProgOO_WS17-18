Enumeration

	Enumerations are types (or special kinds of classes) with a countable set of predefined elements.
	
Assertion

	Assertions are essentially debugging statements that show an error when they aren't met.
	They should only be used internally for private methods and not for public methods, because thats what throwing exceptions is for.
	Since they are not enabled by default they don't take away any performance when left in the code and so improve maintainability.
	
Precondition / Postcondition

	Check arguments before computation. / Check return value after computations.

Invariant

	Something that is going to be true. But since we have assertions now we can check anyway.

Method / object decomposition

	By decomposing a difficult task into smaller, simpler tasks programming becomes less complex.
	Method decomposition lets you execute tasks multiple times without twice the code.
	With object decomposition you can access the resulting object of a previously run task and do something to it.
